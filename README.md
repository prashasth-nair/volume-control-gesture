# Volume Control using Hand Gesture

This Python project utilizes OpenCV to control the volume of your computer using hand gestures. It calculates the distance between the thumb and index finger to determine the desired volume level.

## Features

- Control volume using hand gestures
- Calculates distance between thumb and index finger for precise control
- Adjust volume in real-time based on hand movement

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
  
## Deployment

Clone the repository to your local machine

```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/prashasth-nair/volume-control-gesture.git
```


Install the required libraries using the following command

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

```


Run the script

```bash
  $ python volume_control.py

```


## How to Use

- The script captures video feed from the default camera.
- Position your hand in front of the camera with your thumb and index finger extended.
- Move your hand closer or further apart to adjust the volume level.
